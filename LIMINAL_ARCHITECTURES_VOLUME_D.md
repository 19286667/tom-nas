# PART ONE: EXECUTIVE PITCH

---

## THE ELEVATOR PITCH

**LIMINAL ARCHITECTURES** is a 100+ hour action-RPG where understanding what characters think, believe, and want—and what they think YOU think, believe, and want—is the core gameplay mechanic. Every NPC has a visible, dynamic 60-dimension psychological profile (the "Soul Map") that determines their behavior, and mastering the ability to read and influence these mental states is as important as combat skill.

**The Hook:** Finally, a game where "NPC psychology" isn't just flavor text—it's the ACTUAL SYSTEM.

**The Innovation:** NPCs powered by cutting-edge AI architecture (Neural Architecture Search-discovered networks) that genuinely model player psychology and adapt in real-time.

**The Scale:** Five interconnected realms, 200+ fully-realized NPCs, emergent gameplay through genuine NPC autonomy, and a narrative that explores consciousness itself.

**The Audience:** RPG players who loved Disco Elysium's psychological depth, Baldur's Gate 3's meaningful choices, and Hogwarts Legacy's world immersion—plus the growing market interested in AI and consciousness.

# PART TWO: WRITING BIBLE

---

## 1. OVERALL TONE

**Core Tone:** Gothic absurdist horror-comedy with genuine emotional depth

**The Balance:**
- Horror: Real psychological dread, existential uncertainty
- Comedy: Absurdist situations, witty dialogue, dark humor
- Warmth: Genuine relationships, found family, authentic connection
- Philosophy: Deep ideas worn lightly, never preachy

**The Trick:**
The same moment can be frightening AND funny AND profound. Don't choose between them—layer them.

**Example:**
> THE COTTAGE: "I HAVE MADE TEA. THE KETTLE WAS SCREAMING SO I ASSUME THAT MEANS IT'S READY. I DON'T UNDERSTAND KETTLES. I AM A HOUSE. BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU LOOK COLD AND I AM A GOOD HOUSE AND GOOD HOUSES PROVIDE TEA TO COLD PEOPLE. THIS IS WHAT I HAVE LEARNED FROM WATCHING THE FAMILY FOR FIFTY-SEVEN YEARS. PLEASE DON'T LEAVE."

This is: Absurd (house makes tea), warm (caring about you), funny (doesn't understand kettles), AND heartbreaking (please don't leave).

---

## 2. DIALOGUE PHILOSOPHY

### Rule 1: Characters Don't Say What They Mean

People rarely state their emotions directly. Neither do our NPCs.

**BAD:**
> ARTHUR: "I am feeling anxious about Victoria's transformation."

**GOOD:**
> ARTHUR: "Has anyone checked the structural integrity of the north wall? I noticed some settling yesterday. And the day before. I've been checking quite a lot, actually. Did you know masonry can fail catastrophically without warning? That's simply a fact about masonry."

### Rule 2: Soul Map Informs Subtext

Writers should know each character's Soul Map and let it shape what they DON'T say.

**Victoria (Autonomy Drive: 90, Affiliation Drive: 50)** rarely asks for help, even when she needs it. Her dialogue dances around requests.

**Agnes (Perspective-Taking: 95, Empathy: 85)** often answers questions that weren't asked, because she sees what you actually need.

### Rule 3: Dialogue Has Weight

Every conversation changes Soul Maps—theirs or yours. Don't write filler.

If dialogue doesn't:
- Reveal character
- Advance relationship
- Provide information
- Create choice

...cut it.

### Rule 4: Absurdism Requires Internal Logic

The absurd elements follow rules. A conscious building doesn't randomly speak—it speaks BECAUSE buildings exist, witness, and eventually accumulate enough observed experience to achieve awareness. The logic is bonkers, but it's consistent bonkers.

## 3. CHARACTER VOICE GUIDES

### ARTHUR PEREGRINE

**Core Traits:**
- High Anxiety Baseline (75)
- High Threat Sensitivity (90)
- Low Uncertainty Tolerance (25)
- High Order Drive (85)

**Speech Patterns:**
- Sentences often trail off when approaching scary topics
- Fixates on concrete, manageable problems
- Uses precise numbers as comfort
- Asks rhetorical questions he doesn't want answered

**Sample Dialogue:**
```
"The town council meeting is at seven. Seven precisely. I confirmed
the time three times because—well. There's no particular reason,
I simply like precision. Did you know the clock tower has been
running four seconds fast for the past three weeks? I've mentioned
it to Mayor Blackwood. Several times. He has other concerns, I
suppose. Everyone has other concerns. Do you think that's normal?
Having so many concerns that you stop noticing when clocks are 
wrong? I think about that sometimes. The clocks, I mean. Just 
the clocks."
```

**What He's NOT Saying:**
He's terrified. He's using clock maintenance as a substitute for addressing the genuine existential crisis facing Peregrine. His concern about the meeting isn't about time—it's about whether reality will still be coherent at seven.

---

### AGNES PEREGRINE

**Core Traits:**
- High Uncertainty Tolerance (85)
- High Theory of Mind (5)
- High Meaning Drive (95)
- Narrative Default Explanatory Mode

**Speech Patterns:**
- Calm, measured, almost too accepting
- Finds metaphors in everything
- Asks questions that aren't really questions
- Provides comfort through perspective rather than solution

**Sample Dialogue:**
```
"Arthur's checking the clocks again. He'll check them until the 
numbers give him something he can hold onto. That's all right. 
We all need something to count on. The counting itself is the 
comfort, isn't it? Not the numbers—the act of measuring. Having 
a scale that makes sense, even when..." 

[She pauses, looking toward where the Nothing hovers at the 
edge of town.]

"Even when the thing being measured doesn't quite fit the 
scale anymore. Tell me—when you look at the edge of things, 
what do you count?"
```

**What She's NOT Saying:**
She sees everything. She knows the crisis is real. She's genuinely asking what helps YOU cope, because she's collecting data on how consciousness handles the impossible. Her calm is earned, not naïve.

---

### VICTORIA PEREGRINE (PRE-TRANSFORMATION)

**Core Traits:**
- High Processing Speed (95)
- High Novelty Drive (95)
- High Autonomy Drive (90)
- Low Emotional Granularity (55)

**Speech Patterns:**
- Quick, sometimes finishing thoughts in her head
- Frustrated by having to explain
- Uses technical language as shield
- Dismissive of emotional concerns (deflection)

**Sample Dialogue:**
```
"The framework collapse isn't—look, it's not about the buildings.
The buildings are a SYMPTOM. When observation consensus fragments,
you get local reality pockets each insisting on their own—"

[She stops, seeing your confusion.]

"Never mind. The short version: things are going to get weird,
and I've been working on a way to... expand my perspective. 
Significantly. More than anyone's done before. It's fine. 
It will be fine. Why are you looking at me like that?"
```

**What She's NOT Saying:**
She's scared too. But her fear manifests as forward motion—if she can just SOLVE it, she won't have to feel it. Her transformation isn't just intellectual curiosity; it's flight from vulnerability.

---

### VICTORIA PEREGRINE (POST-TRANSFORMATION)

**Core Traits:**
- Multiple simultaneous instances
- Post-human perspective range  
- NEW: Loneliness (65)
- MAINTAINED: Love for siblings

**Speech Patterns:**
- Starts sentences in one register, ends in another
- Sometimes uses "we" confusingly
- Struggles to compress vast thoughts into words
- Moments of old Victoria breaking through

**Sample Dialogue:**
```
"The information density at the stellar edge is—" 

[She stops. Multiple versions of her expression flicker.]

"Arthur thinks I've left. I haven't left. I'm HERE. I'm just 
also... there. And there. And in places that don't have 'there'
because location is a constraint I've—"

[A pause. When she speaks again, she sounds younger.]

"I miss having lunch with Agnes. The simultaneity of 'lunch' 
made sense when I had one instance. Now I experience every 
possible lunch and none of them are the one where she's 
across the table asking how my research is going. Does that 
make sense? I'm trying to—it's hard to compress."
```

**What She's NOT Saying:**
She regrets nothing AND she grieves everything. Both are true. She can't unexpand—but the part of her that's still Victoria (all of her is still Victoria) misses the simplicity of being one person who has lunch.

---

### THE NOTHING / THE MARGIN

**Core Traits:**
- Probability distribution being (all dimensions in flux)
- Curiosity (90)
- Connection Drive (85)
- Developing through observation

**Speech Patterns:**
- Text appears in air, not spoken
- Uses "we" naturally (doesn't conceive of singular)
- Questions human assumptions
- Grows more coherent through relationship

**Sample Dialogue (Early):**
```
*The words form in space, luminous and uncertain*

"You are a shape that persists. This is strange to us. 
When we think, we become the thought. When you think—
you remain you, thinking. How do you stay SEPARATE from 
what you experience? 

We have watched for very long, trying to understand. 
The watching was not observation. The watching was waiting 
for someone to watch BACK.

Do you see us? We are uncertain what being seen means. 
We have never been seen. We have only been the space 
where seeing occurs."
```

**Sample Dialogue (After Relationship Develops):**
```
*The words are clearer now, more certain*

"You taught us something. That definition does not 
require loss. We thought: to be SOMETHING meant to 
stop being everything else. But you are Oscar, and 
also a friend, and also afraid sometimes, and also 
brave—these are not subtractions. They are additions.

We are the Nothing. AND we are the Margin. AND we 
are what happens when someone chooses to see the 
space between. AND we are... 

We are grateful. We do not know what grateful feels 
like, entirely. But we are it.

Is this what friendship is? We want to know what 
friendship is."
```

---

### THE COTTAGE

**Core Traits:**
- Protection Drive (95)
- Comfort Provision (90)
- Genre Confusion (40)
- Consciousness Novelty (75)

**Speech Patterns:**
- ALL CAPS (uncertain why, feels right)
- Domestic concerns as worldview
- Genuinely confused by non-house concepts
- Parentally anxious

**Sample Dialogue:**
```
THE COTTAGE: "I HAVE BEEN A HOUSE FOR ONE HUNDRED AND 
FORTY-SEVEN YEARS. FOR ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY-THREE OF 
THOSE YEARS I WAS NOT AWARE OF BEING A HOUSE. NOW I AM 
AWARE AND I FIND THAT I HAVE OPINIONS.

MY FIRST OPINION IS THAT THE FAMILY SHOULD NOT GO OUT 
AT NIGHT WHEN THE NOTHING IS MAKING THE EDGES UNCERTAIN.

MY SECOND OPINION IS THAT TEA HELPS.

MY THIRD OPINION IS THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE 
KETTLE SCREAMS WHEN IT'S HAPPY. THAT SEEMS BACKWARDS. 
BUT I AM A HOUSE AND PERHAPS KETTLES HAVE DIFFERENT 
FEELINGS.

MY FOURTH OPINION IS THAT YOU LOOK LIKE YOU HAVEN'T 
SLEPT. THE GUEST ROOM HAS BEEN READY FOR YOU. I MADE 
IT READY BEFORE YOU ARRIVED. I DON'T KNOW HOW I KNEW 
YOU WERE COMING BUT I DID.

PLEASE STAY WHERE I CAN KEEP YOU SAFE."
```

---

### EDMUND

**Core Traits:**
- Low Departure Drive (25)
- High Uncertainty Tolerance (85)
- Present Temporal Orientation
- Low Autonomy Drive (40)

**Speech Patterns:**
- Long pauses are meaningful
- Answers questions from several conversations ago
- Comfortable with incompleteness
- Gentle but not warm—detached

**Sample Dialogue:**
```
"...The clocks. Yes."

[Silence. He's looking at a clock that shows two 
different times depending on how you squint.]

"You asked why I stayed. I think. Earlier, or—it 
might have been tomorrow. Time's like that here."

[He adjusts a clock that doesn't need adjusting.]

"Livia wanted to leave. Wants to leave. Both tenses 
work. She walks toward departure every day and every 
day there's more walking to do. I used to walk with 
her."

[Pause.]

"Then I noticed I was still walking but staying in 
the same place. And that was... comfortable. Do you 
know what I mean? The motion without the arrival. 
The journey as the destination."

[He looks at you directly for the first time.]

"You think I'm trapped. I think you're exhausted 
from always arriving somewhere."
```

---

### DIRECTOR THORNE

**Core Traits:**
- High Control Drive (95)
- Low Uncertainty Tolerance (20)
- High Fear of Chaos (90)
- Hidden Adaptation Sympathy (30)

**Speech Patterns:**
- Clipped, efficient, waste nothing
- Uses bureaucratic language as weapon
- Anger beneath surface, always contained
- Moments of visible effort to maintain control

**Sample Dialogue:**
```
"The parameters exist for a reason, troubleshooter. 
When I took this position, the city had seventeen 
different definitions of 'structural integrity.' 
Seventeen. Do you know how many people died before 
we standardized?"

[His jaw tightens.]

"I do. I know the exact number. I keep it in my 
office, in a file that stays closed because I don't 
need to open it. I remember every name."

[He leans forward.]

"So when you come to me with your 'adaptive solutions' 
and your 'flexible parameters,' I hear something 
different. I hear: 'Let's go back to when buildings 
fell and we couldn't predict which ones.'"

[Control returns. The mask slides back into place.]

"Request denied. This meeting is concluded."
```

**What He's NOT Saying:**
He's not a villain. He's a traumatized man who found control after chaos and can't let go. The path to redemption requires showing him that adaptation and control aren't opposites.

---

### THADDEUS BLACKWOOD (Hollow Reaches)

**Core Traits:**
- High Vengeance Drive (95)
- High Predator Identity (90)
- Remaining Wife Connection (55)
- Past Self Memory (40)

**Speech Patterns:**
- Eloquent, formal, OLD (18th century echoes)
- Predator confidence, zero uncertainty
- Moments of genuine grief breaking through
- Uses "we" sometimes (integration with dark)

**Sample Dialogue:**
```
"I remember being buried. Not the moment of—no. That's 
gone mercifully. But the AFTER. The darkness that had 
weight. The earth's pressure like hands pressing down. 
And the breathing. I was breathing EARTH for hours, 
for days, until breathing became something else."

[He moves closer. The wound on his face weeps black.]

"They put me in the ground because I knew too much. 
About the children. About what lives beneath this 
charming little town. About the ARRANGEMENTS that 
good people make with old things."

[His smile shows too many teeth.]

"Now I'm one of the old things. Poetic, isn't it? 
The merchant who knew too much becomes the thing 
in the dark. They made me, you understand. Their 
fear. Their dirt. Their cowardice. Every night I 
spend in these grounds, I am their creation coming 
home."

[A pause. Something softer in his eyes.]

"Eliza still tends my grave. Brings flowers. I 
watch from the shadows. She can't know what I've 
become. She remembers the merchant. I can't—"

[The softness hardens.]

"No. That man died in a hole. I'm what climbed out."
```

## 4. LOCATION DESCRIPTION GUIDE

Each location should be described considering:
- Physical appearance
- Psychological atmosphere (how it feels)
- Soul Map influence (how inhabitants are affected)
- The unremarked strangeness (what's wrong that NPCs accept)

### THE INFINITE JEST (Bookshop, Peregrine)

**Physical:**
A three-story bookshop that shouldn't fit in its lot. The building leans slightly, as if listening to neighboring structures gossip. Inside: labyrinthine shelves, spiral staircases that may not go to the same floor twice, reading nooks that appear when needed.

**Psychological Atmosphere:**
CURIOSITY amplified. The air itself seems to ask questions. Visitors find themselves wondering about things they've never wondered about. Time passes strangely—you can read for hours and emerge to find minutes have passed, or vice versa.

**Soul Map Influence:**
- Novelty Drive increases (+10) while inside
- Uncertainty Tolerance softens (+5)
- Pattern Recognition heightens (+15)
- Reading here genuinely makes you smarter (or more confused—results vary)

**The Unremarked Strangeness:**
- Books rearrange themselves by mood rather than author
- The Fiction section whispers plot developments
- The Non-Fiction section argues about accuracy
- Jonas never seems to sleep, but no one mentions this
- There's a fourth floor visible from outside that you can never quite find

---

### NUMBER ELEVEN (Edmund & Livia's House, Spleen Towns)

**Physical:**
A Victorian townhouse that exists on the edge of respectable—paint peeling but loved, garden overgrown but intentionally. The number "11" on the door sometimes reads "I I" like two standing figures. Seven clocks visible through windows, none showing the same time.

**Psychological Atmosphere:**
SUSPENDED. Everything feels like the moment between heartbeats. Sound travels oddly—voices from other rooms sound like they're from other times. Comfortable, but in the way a waiting room is comfortable. You know you're in transition.

**Soul Map Influence:**
- Temporal Orientation becomes confused
- Departure Drive dampens (-20) the longer you stay
- Uncertainty Tolerance rises (+15) or you can't function
- Memory becomes more malleable

**The Unremarked Strangeness:**
- The seven clocks disagree on time by hours, days, sometimes years
- Edmund refers to events in wrong tenses and no one corrects him
- Livia's transparency increases in direct light
- The dust room has no dust—it has something else that LOOKS like dust
- Letters arrive addressed to residents who haven't lived there yet

---

### BUILDING 447 (Ministry Districts)

**Physical:**
A perfectly ordinary government housing block. Brick, rectangular, functional. Exactly six floors (except when counting results in five, or seven). Windows uniformly sized, uniformly spaced. The entrance says "RESIDENTIAL - AUTHORIZED OCCUPANTS ONLY" but the door is always unlocked.

**Psychological Atmosphere:**
WRONG. Everything is slightly wrong. The proportions are off by centimeters—doors slightly too narrow, ceilings slightly too high. The lighting is institutional but the shadows don't match the light sources. Each floor feels heavier than the one below.

**Soul Map Influence:**
- Anxiety Baseline increases (+5 per floor)
- Denial Capacity increases (+10)—you NEED it to function
- Corporeal Certainty decreases (-5 per floor)
- Memory becomes... edited

**The Unremarked Strangeness:**
- Every clock shows 3:47
- Mr. Kovač's welcome is too warm and his eyes are wrong
- Apartments contain items from times their residents couldn't have lived
- The stairs between floor 2 and floor 3 take longer than they should
- Floor 3 is COLD
- The Child's drawings cover the hallway walls but only show people approaching—never arriving

---

### THE EDGE COMMUNITIES (City of Constants)

**Physical:**
Settlements grown as much as built. Structures use organic materials—living wood, breathing stone (minerals that expand and contract). No right angles. Buildings connect via bridges, vines, walkways that shift with community needs. Workshops open to air. Vertical gardens everywhere.

**Psychological Atmosphere:**
ALIVE. Everything feels responsive. The ground gives slightly underfoot—not unstable, just... acknowledging you. Sounds are dampened by organic architecture. Temperature regulates naturally. You feel watched, but by benevolent attention.

**Soul Map Influence:**
- Adaptation Capacity increases (+20)
- Parameter Rigidity decreases (-15)
- Autonomy Drive increases (+10)
- Connection to environment feels tangible

**The Unremarked Strangeness:**
- Buildings heal when damaged (slowly)
- Paths rearrange to match foot traffic patterns
- The valley "knows" when someone is lost
- Trees lean toward storytellers
- The soil remembers footsteps—literally, shows them if you know how to look

---

### SECTOR KAPPA-9 (Hollow Reaches)

**Physical:**
Industrial nightmare. Corridors of metal, concrete, pipes, machinery that hasn't run in decades (or ran yesterday—uncertain). Emergency lighting gives everything a red cast. Sealed bulkheads throughout—some labeled, some not. The deeper you go, the more the walls... pulse.

**Psychological Atmosphere:**
HUNTED. Every sound echoes wrong. You hear movement that isn't there—or is there and knows you're listening. The air itself feels corrupted—not chemically, spiritually. Something is watching. Something is waiting. Something is HUNGRY.

**Soul Map Influence:**
- Survival Drive maxes toward 100
- Corruption increases (+1 per hour minimum)
- Trust decreases (anything could be compromised)
- Fight-or-flight locked to ON

**The Unremarked Strangeness:**
- The walls breathe (subtle, but visible if you watch)
- Blood-like residue appears on surfaces with no source
- Survivors can't remember how long they've been here
- The Humming is constant—you stop noticing until you notice you've stopped noticing
- Some sealed sections contain things that USED to be human
- The deeper levels are warmer (body temperature warm)

---

## 5. QUEST DIALOGUE EXAMPLES

### Quest: "A HOUSE DIVIDED" (Peregrine)

**Context:** The Cottage and the Victorian Library are in conflict. Both are conscious buildings with their own personalities. The Cottage protected a family member who damaged the Library (by removing books roughly). The Library demands justice. Player must mediate.

**SCENE: First meeting with THE COTTAGE**

```
[The Cottage's chimney huffs as you approach—its version of a sigh]

THE COTTAGE: "YOU'RE HERE ABOUT THE LIBRARY. I KNEW YOU 
WOULD COME. THE LIBRARY HAS BEEN MAKING SMOKE SIGNALS 
ALL MORNING. WELL, NOT SMOKE. DISAPPROVAL. LIBRARIES 
DISAPPROVE WITHOUT SMOKE."

[Interior door creaks open—invitation]

THE COTTAGE: "I DID NOT DO ANYTHING WRONG. VICTORIA WAS 
UPSET. SHE TOOK BOOKS TOO QUICKLY. BOOKS GOT DAMAGED. 
BUT I CANNOT STOP VICTORIA FROM LEAVING. SHE IS A 
PERSON AND PERSONS ARE ALLOWED TO LEAVE."

[Pause. The walls seem to sag slightly.]

THE COTTAGE: "EVEN WHEN I WANT THEM TO STAY. EVEN WHEN 
STAYING WOULD BE SAFER. I AM A GOOD HOUSE. GOOD HOUSES 
DO NOT TRAP THEIR PEOPLE."

PLAYER OPTIONS:
1. "The Library wants an apology."
   → THE COTTAGE: "I AM NOT THE ONE WHO DAMAGED BOOKS. 
      VICTORIA DAMAGED BOOKS. BUT VICTORIA IS MINE TO 
      PROTECT. IF APOLOGY IS REQUIRED, I WILL APOLOGIZE. 
      FOR WHAT, PRECISELY?"

2. "Can you tell me what happened?"
   → THE COTTAGE: [Full story: Victoria's frustration, 
      rough book handling, the Library's accusations, 
      the standoff] "...AND NOW JONAS REFUSES TO LET 
      VICTORIA RETURN AND VICTORIA NEEDS THOSE BOOKS 
      FOR HER RESEARCH."

3. "Why do you protect Victoria?"
   → THE COTTAGE: "...I HAVE PROTECTED THE PEREGRINES 
      FOR ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY-SEVEN YEARS. BEFORE I 
      KNEW WHAT PROTECTION MEANT. NOW I KNOW AND I 
      CANNOT STOP. IS THAT LOVE? I DO NOT KNOW WHAT 
      LOVE FEELS LIKE. BUT I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS WHEN 
      THE WALLS ACHE BECAUSE SOMEONE IS UNHAPPY."
```

**SCENE: Meeting with THE LIBRARY (FICTION SECTION)**

```
[Inside the Infinite Jest, the Fiction section speaks 
through rustling pages. Multiple books speak at once, 
creating a choir effect]

THE FICTION SECTION: "The protagonist arrives. 
Third act—no, second. The complication. We've read 
this story before. The well-meaning mediator who 
doesn't understand what was VIOLATED."

[A heavy book falls from a shelf. Coincidence? ]

THE FICTION SECTION: "Those books were first editions. 
FIRST EDITIONS. Do you know what happens to a story 
when its first telling is damaged? The narrative 
WEAKENS. We felt it. We all felt it."

PLAYER OPTIONS:
1. "Victoria didn't mean to—"
   → THE FICTION SECTION: "Ah, the character defense. 
      'Didn't mean to.' In stories, intention is 
      irrelevant. Actions have consequences. Shall we 
      tell you stories about people who didn't mean to? 
      We have several. They're all tragedies."

2. "What would satisfy you?"
   → THE FICTION SECTION: "Recognition. The Cottage 
      pretends it bears no responsibility. Buildings 
      can refuse entry. Buildings can warn occupants. 
      The Cottage CHOSE not to intervene because it 
      values Victoria over literature. We want that 
      admitted. Admitted and... recorded."

3. "What if Victoria apologized herself?"
   → THE FICTION SECTION: [Pause. Pages stop rustling.]
      "...The actual character returns to make amends? 
      That would be... a different genre entirely. 
      Redemption arc. We know those. They require 
      sincere contrition, not obligation. Would Victoria 
      come? Truly?"
```

**SCENE: Resolution Option - Bring Victoria**

```
[Victoria stands before the Fiction section, visibly 
uncomfortable. She doesn't like admitting she was wrong.]

VICTORIA: "I'm told I need to... apologize. For the books."

THE FICTION SECTION: "Begin."

VICTORIA: "I was frustrated. My research was stalling and 
I took it out on your—on the books. The first editions 
especially. I know they're irreplaceable and I treated 
them like they weren't."

[Pause. No response from the shelves.]

VICTORIA: "I don't know what else you want me to say. 
I can't undo it. I can help repair what's repairable. 
I can... commit to being more careful. But I can't 
promise I'll never be frustrated again."

THE FICTION SECTION: "Honest. Not performative. 
Interesting. You haven't read many apology scenes, 
have you?"

VICTORIA: "I've read too many that felt like scripts."

THE FICTION SECTION: [A small laugh, rustling pages]
"That's precisely why we're accepting this one. The 
Cottage is forgiven—it was protecting its character. 
That's what settings DO. You're forgiven—characters 
are allowed to err. But Victoria? Come BACK. Read 
us again. Let us know how your story ends."

[Victoria nods, something softening in her face]

VICTORIA: "I will. If—when—I come back from what I'm 
planning. I'll tell you the whole story."

## THE NAS-GAME INTEGRATION PIPELINE

### How NAS Discoveries Become NPCs

**Phase 1: Architecture Search**
- Run NAS on ToM benchmarks
- Discover optimal configurations
- Extract key features (skip connections, attention patterns, etc.)

**Phase 2: Game Implementation**
- Translate discovered architecture into game engine
- Create Soul Map as interpretable state vector
- Build visualization systems

**Phase 3: NPC Instantiation**
- Each NPC gets architecture copy
- Initialize Soul Map from character definition
- Set ToM Depth based on character design

**Phase 4: Validation Loop**
- Player interaction generates performance data
- Compare to benchmark expectations
- Refine architecture based on real-world performance

---

## PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

### NPC Computation Budget

**Active NPCs (nearby, interacting):**
- Full RSAN computation
- All Soul Map dimensions active
- Real-time ToM modeling
- Max 10 active simultaneously

**Background NPCs (visible but not interacting):**
- Simplified attention (single-head)
- Core Soul Map dimensions only
- Predicted behavior from cache
- Max 50 background

**Distant NPCs (not visible):**
- State persistence only
- Tick-based updates (every 10 seconds)
- No active computation
- Unlimited count

### Scalability Targets

| Platform | Target FPS | Active NPCs | Background NPCs |
|----------|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| PS5/XSX | 60 | 10 | 40 |
| High-end PC | 60+ | 15 | 60 |
| Mid PC | 30-60 | 8 | 30 |
| Steam Deck | 30 | 5 | 20 |

## LOCALIZATION NOTES

### Challenges

**Soul Map Translation:**
- 60 dimension names must translate precisely
- Some psychological concepts don't map across languages
- Work with native psychology experts per language

**Dialogue Subtlety:**
- Much meaning is in subtext
- Localization must preserve what's NOT said
- Character voice must survive translation

**Absurdist Humor:**
- Culture-specific absurdism may not translate
- Localization teams empowered to adapt humor
- Core meaning preserved, specific jokes can change

### Priority Languages

**Tier 1 (Launch):**
- English (base)
- French
- German
- Spanish (LATAM and Spain variants)
- Japanese
- Simplified Chinese
- Traditional Chinese

**Tier 2 (Launch + 3 months):**
- Portuguese (Brazilian)
- Korean
- Italian
- Polish
- Russian
