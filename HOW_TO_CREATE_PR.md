## ✅ After Creating the PR

### Review Your PR
1. Check that all files are included
2. Review the diff to see what changed
3. Read through the description

### Merge Options

You have 3 merge strategies:

**1. Merge Commit (Recommended)**
- Preserves full commit history
- Shows all 6 individual commits
- Best for seeing development progression

**2. Squash and Merge**
- Combines all commits into one
- Cleaner history
- Loses individual commit messages

**3. Rebase and Merge**
- Replays commits on top of main
- Linear history
- Good for clean timeline

**My Recommendation:** Use **Merge Commit** to preserve the detailed history.

### Merge the PR
1. Click the green **"Merge pull request"** button
2. Confirm the merge
3. Delete the branch (optional, GitHub will prompt)
