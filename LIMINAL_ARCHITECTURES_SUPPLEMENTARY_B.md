## 4.2 FACTION MECHANICS

### Reputation System

Each faction tracks:
- **Standing**: -100 (Hostile) to +100 (Exalted)
- **Trust**: How much they share with you
- **Influence**: Your power within faction
- **Visibility**: How known you are to members

### Cross-Faction Dynamics

Some factions are:
- **Allied**: Reputation gains in one boost the other
- **Neutral**: Independent reputation
- **Opposed**: Reputation gains in one damage the other
- **Exclusive**: Joining one prevents joining the other

**Example Relationships:**
- Complementarists ←Allied→ Narrativists, Simulationists
- Parameter Authority ←Opposed→ Adaptationists
- Survivors ←Exclusive→ Consumed
- Standards Division ←Allied→ Archivists
